### New York Citi Bike data visualizations for August 2019

- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.



#### August Peak Hours

- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.
- The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.



#### Checkout times for users

- Weekend rides are highest from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
- Those rides are mostly taken by male users.


## Summary
The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019.


Additional analysis would be beneficial by :
- comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year,
- including weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides.
